// This class wraps a mutex used to prevent deadlocks between the non-render and render threads
// which could happen because of the Objective-C bridge with callbacks that can be forwarded
// back to Lua.
//
// The non-render threads locks the mutex from native callbacks, before processing the Lua callback
// code, or in special cases like closing where we want to make sure that willClose will execute.
//
// When the Render Thread is executing, it locks the mutex to prevent native callbacks from
// synchronizing with the Render Thread.
//
// If the Render Thread must synchronize with the main thread (e.g. readImage), it first
// unlocks the mutex before synchronizing. This will let the main thread process a pending
// callback if needed, running the Lua code on the main thread itself, and then executing
// what the Render Thread requested.
